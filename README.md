# Face-Mask-Detection-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN-
This is a Deep Learning project using a Tensorflow and Keras Libraries to build a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that work a Face Mask Detection dataset obtained from Kaggle. This project predicts on an uploaded image whether the image a person is wearing a face mask or not.
